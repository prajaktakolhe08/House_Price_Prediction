# üè° House Price Prediction Web Application

## Overview
This project is a House Price Prediction Web Application built with Flask and a pre-trained machine learning model. Users can input various house features such as area, overall quality, number of bathrooms, and other attributes, and the application predicts the estimated house price using a Random Forest model. The interactive web interface provides an intuitive way to explore real estate pricing trends based on input data.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for inputting house details
- Predicts house prices based on key features such as Lot Area, Overall Quality, Year Built, etc.
- Utilizes a trained Random Forest model for accurate predictions
- Displays the predicted house price on a results page

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling routes and rendering templates
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for exploratory data analysis and model training
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for training and deploying the Random Forest model
- **Joblib**: Model serialization for loading the trained model
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for user input and result display
